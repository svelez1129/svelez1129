## üëã About Me
Hello! My name is Sergio Velez, an undergrad at MIT studying Computer Science and Engineering(6-3), with a minor in Economics(14). I love
computer science because of my interest for problem-solving and because computer science gives me the tools to build any application I want
for any use-case I need. In particular, I am interested in software engineering, machine learning, and computer systems. I am also studying
economics because of my interest in financial markets and understanding how the world works from an economic point of view.
